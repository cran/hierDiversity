Title: Hierarchical Multiplicative Partitioning of Complex Phenotypes
Author: Zachary Marion, James Fordyce, and Benjamin Fitzpatrick
Maintainer: Zachary Marion <zmarion@vols.utk.edu>
Description: Hierarchical group-wise partitioning of phenotypic diversity into 
    within-group (alpha), among-group (beta), and pooled-total (gamma) 
    components using Hill numbers.
    Turnover and overlap are also calculated as standardized alternatives to
    beta diversity. Hierarchical bootstrapping is used to approximate 
    uncertainty around each diversity component.
